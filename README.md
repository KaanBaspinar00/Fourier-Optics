I have studied Fourier optics using David George Voelz's book, "Computational Fourier Optics: A MATLAB Tutorial." Currently, I am addressing some issues I encountered in Chapter 3, and I plan to compile a PDF document detailing my findings on Fourier optics.

Additionally, I intend to broaden my understanding by studying the following texts:

* "Fourier Optics and Computational Imaging" by Kedar Khare, published in 2023.

* "Fundamentals of Optical Computing Technology," published in 2018.
  
* "Oppenheim Signals and Systems," published in 1996.

* "Theory of Remote Image Formation" by Richard E. Blahut, published in 2005.

* "Nonlinear Fiber Optics" by Govind Agrawal, published in 2007 (cited twice).
 
I plan to prepare Python scripts based on these studies and share my notes accordingly. Should you have any questions or wish to discuss these topics further, please feel free to contact me via email at baspinarlee@gmail.com.
