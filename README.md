# Fourier-Optics
I studied Fourier optics using the book: 
David George Voelz - Computational Fourier Optics _ a MATLAB tutorial

In CH3, there are some problems which Ä± should fix. 
I will prapare a pdf document to show the details of the Fourier optics. 

I am going to study to these books too:

* Fourier Optics and Computational Imaging, Kedar Khare 2023

* Fundamentals of Optical Computing Technology 2018

* Oppenheim Signals and Systems 1996

* Theory of Remote Image Formation Richard E. Blahut 2005

* Govind Agrawal - Nonlinear fiber optics 2007

* Govind Agrawal - Nonlinear fiber optics 2007

If I can, I will prepare the python codes and share my notes.
